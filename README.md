## Overview
This portfolio showcases my work from the **High-Performance Data Analytics (HPDA)** module.  
The course focused on understanding and applying methods for processing and analyzing **large-scale datasets** using **parallel** and **distributed computing** techniques.

Each folder in this repository represents one week of the module, containing exercises, slides, and code implementations.

## Focus Areas

### 1. Data-Driven Problem Solving
- Designed analytical pipelines for real-world and scientific use cases.  
- Translated high-level questions into measurable computational tasks.  
- Connected business and research problems to data models and architectures.

### 2. Data Modeling and Management
- Developed and compared **relational**, **NoSQL**, and **columnar** data models.  
- Created and optimized SQL schemas and queries for analytical workloads.  
- Implemented and queried data using **MongoDB** and **Hive**.

### 3. Distributed and Parallel Processing
- Executed data processing workflows using **Hadoop**, **Spark**, and **MapReduce**.  
- Explored in-memory computation and stream processing with **PySpark**.  
- Benchmarked system performance for different processing paradigms.

### 4. System Design and Performance Analysis
- Modeled performance and scalability of distributed systems.  
- Evaluated I/O and network bottlenecks for large-scale data operations.  
- Implemented performance models to estimate execution times across hardware configurations.

### 5. Visual and Exploratory Analytics
- Applied **visual analytics** techniques for data exploration and result interpretation.  
- Designed workflows integrating computation and visualization in scientific contexts.
