# Interesting finds

- have been using bash for a while, so nothing super crazy here, as it was mostly targeted at beginners. 

However, some interesting findings i still notice in bash: 
- echos don't need quotes around them (as someone used to pythonic syntax, this is very weird to me) 
- pressing enter in the middle of a statement to submit is fine, again, weird
- the calender looks so pretty O_O (cal)
