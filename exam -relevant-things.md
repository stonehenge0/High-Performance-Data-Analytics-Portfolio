- Be able to create a Mongo DB/(XML) Document Database for exam. Apparently a major bottleneck in the last exam for people.

- Für graph based things usually RDF (but double-check this in the slides)
- anderer Name für fact based modeling ist event-sourcing irgenwdie anders mit dokumenting oder nicht dokumentiong of states
- look into fact based models! Really relevant. For example how to put a fact based thing inside a document base -> inside is json things and then for every change to the Wikipedia article create an "event" that is one change to the article
- fact checked is pretty usefule for understanding why things came to be the thing they are with those events. In other databases you don't really have this information and then idk you change a users password but you dont know who or when or why cause it was never recorded.
